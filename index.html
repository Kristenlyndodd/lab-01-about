                    There are many myths about cooking pasta. Adding oil to the water, placing the pasta in warm water before bringing it up to the boil, 
                rinsing the pasta after – all just a few cooking ‘tips’ that should be avoided at all costs.

                    All you need to do is follow a few simple rules and you will have perfectly cooked pasta time and time again.

                    It is important to use a large pan and a lot of water to give the pasta room to move and expand whilst cooking, and to help prevent it sticking together. 
            Plenty of salt is also crucial, as it helps to cook the pasta and adds flavour.

                <ol type="A"></ol>
                <li>Fill a large pan with water and bring to a rolling boil </ls>
                <li>Season the water with roughly 1 tablespoon of salt</li>
                <li>Stir the water and add the pasta, ensuring it is completely submerged</li>
                <li>Cook for roughly 8–10 minutes (depending on the type of pasta – some shapes may take a little longer or cook more quickly). Stir the pasta occasionally to prevent it clumping together</li>
                <li>To check that the pasta is cooked, take a piece out the water and taste it – it should be soft with a slightly al dente centre</li>
                <li>Drain the pasta in a colander. If you are serving it with a sauce you may want to reserve a little of the cooking water to add to it. Don’t drain it too thoroughly, as the starchy water will stop it sticking together</li>
                <li>ou can simply serve with a little grated Parmesan and some olive oil, or with a sauce of your choice</li>
             </ul>
